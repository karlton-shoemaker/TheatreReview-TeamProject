m3-reviews-site-team-divas created by GitHub Classroom
This was originally a group project created by Karlton Shoemaker, Shannon Adams, and Mary Kemp (team "divas"). I have recreated the repository here so that my contributions can be displayed.

## Overview
This project is a website created using MVC with the Entity Framework Core that is a collection of Musical Theatre reviews. 

## Features
There are pages for each musical on the site with a list of the various reviews. Users can submit their own reviews and also remove and update them. Musicals can be added and reviewed as well.

### Specific Features
* If a user tries to add a musical on the list, they will not be allowed to do so.
* Users can add an image from the internet for any added musical.
* If no image is provided, there will be a default displayed instead.
* Users can delete reviews, but not musicals.

## Special Thanks
Thank you to Carlos Lopez, Davis Murphy, Andy Kohler, and We Can Code IT for teaching us how to do all of this!!!
